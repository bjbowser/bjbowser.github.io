              </h2>
              <p>I found this request for positive nonfiction stories recently and I think I'll throw my hat in the ring! AIE is hosting this submission call. Thank you for doing this AIE!! They are a small publishing company located in Wisconsin and are looking for incredible stories about experiences where someone has gone out of their way to help others.</p>
              <p>Positive stories about people helping other people when faced with difficult circumstances with min of 500 words and a max of 1500 words and a deadline of 11/1/2020. I'd say that's enough time for me to have something good and edited!</p>
              <p>Even better, they will take more than one submission per person, but only one of your stories can be selected. I really like writing positive/uplifting stories so I'm on it!</p>
              <p>For other interested authors, check out their call for submission <a href="https://aieint.net/submissions">here</a> for all the deets!</p>
              <p>UPDATE! I have submitted two stories before the deadline! I hope all who were able to submit have one of their pieces chosen!</p>
              <p class="mb-0">DOUBLE UPDATE: from AIE I was told neither story was chosen. "Unfortunately, they were not selected. They were good stories, but not exactly what we were looking for. Please, keep writing and sending your material to agencies and publishers. You have potential!!"</p>
