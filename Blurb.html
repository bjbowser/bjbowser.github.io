              <p>Lillian had planned out her life. First, she graduated from her university with a degree in Journalism and then she received a rare opportunity to write for highly rated newspaper at the young age of 23. Now, she just needs to land and write an exposé to complete her dream of becoming a household name synonymous with Diane Sawyer or Christiane Amanpour, her heroes! She figured it wasn't going to be easy. However, when she gets an assignment for a story on Russia's opposition party and how they are handling the fear and danger of going against the elite in power, she's ready for the task! She's no stranger to dealing with people in power misusing that power so she feels this story is right up her alley. The problem is that her editor, the person in power in her life, refuses to help her and placed an unfair deadline on her. Lillian doesn't know the Russian language or Cyrillic alphabet, but refuses to let anything stop her! This is her best shot to fulfill her dream, so she'll do anything to find the story and complete the article including flying to Russia!</p>
              <p class="mb-0">Patya Fedorenko has held a mid-level posistion in the Kremlin's finance ministry, happily, under Dimitry Medvedev for much of his life. Once Mr Medvedev stepped down, his successor, Vladimir Putin displaced all of Medvedev's appointments, Patya included. He didn't mind that, it's just business as usual. However, when his younger sister gets kidnapped and forced into marriage to an appointee of the new government, Patya's had enough! He started researching his new brother-in-law and did not like what he found. His poking around upset too many people and he was forced to hide underground. There, he tries to invalidate his sister's marriage, free her, and get his, hopefully ex, brother-in-law fired. But, Patya finds it's not easy to get assistance working against someone who holds the president's favor. Hopefully Patya finds a sympathetic voice to help him save his sister!</p>
