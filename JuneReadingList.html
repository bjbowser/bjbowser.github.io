              </h2>
              <p>Early June I read the 4th book of Faith Hunter's Soulwood series, Circle of the Moon. I had been hoping it could recreate the magic of the first book, but sadly it didn't come back. I got a little annoyed with how Nell is so powerful but then also is so goody goody that she can't be proactive with those special powers. So you want to avoid the bloodlust... I guess that's ok, maybe? Could we maybe read more about Nell flipping over to the dark side and less cop procedure and meetings? I do plan to pick up the next book though. Hoping we see a darker side of her then!</p>
              <p>I wanted to switch to a totally different genre for the next book so I picked up Sofie Kelly's Sleight of Paw. It's from the Magical Cats Mystery series of which all the novels are Cosy Mysteries and doesn't disappoint as one! I read the first book, Curiosity Thrilled the Cat, previously and book 2 is great if you are looking for a light mystery. It's an easy solve but that's perfectly fine if you like cats, magical or not, and like to have them in your mysteries.</p>
              <p class="mb-0">For my last picks, I went back to urban fantasy with Ilona Andrews' Kate Daniels series. Kate Daniels is a mercenary in Atlanta in a world where magic and technology fight for primacy. I'm entertained by the world, the setting but the series is not for the faint of heart. I read both Magic Strikes and Magic Bleeds this month and they were very similar to the previous books in the series where the action is happening at a breakneak pace. Remember to pause and breathe every so often fellow readers! I'll own up to it, I grabbed the next in the series even though I get a bit stressed out reading novels of Kate. I don't care for how badly Kate gets hurt and then is up in another fight the next month, week, day, HOUR! But... you were unconsious for a week after almost dying and... here you are in another fight :/ If you like urban fantasy, strong female leads and can suspend disbelief, then you will like the books in this series!</p>
